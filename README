stars
-----

 This repo contains code related to simulate moving through a starfield in C.
I originally wrote 'stars,' (now called sstars) using SDL. Recently, I moved
the logic for generating and rendering a starfield onto a 2D plane into a
library and built xstars. xstars is an X client app that draws a starfield
into the root window.
